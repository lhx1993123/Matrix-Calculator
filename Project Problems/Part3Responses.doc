Part 3: Power Method Question One
      The Leslie Matrix shown represents a growth model for a particular urban area which is characterized by the “f”, the number of female members reaching “n”, which is a specified age group. In this case, since there are nine groups n1=0 – 9.  The “f” values, then, make sense as the numbers are [1.2   1.1   .9   .1] for age groups 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, and 40-50 respectively. This means that people in that specific age group had their offspring between the ages of 10 – 50, which makes sense. Furthermore, there is an initial increase in the diagonal “s”, which represents survivability of a certain offspring up to that age group. The number goes up initially to indicate that many offspring are surviving up to a certain age, but then drops at older ages to indicate when the offspring begin to die off. 
      As far as social factors are concerned, there is a lot of sense in the interpretation of this argument. Simple factors are dying of natural causes or disease as age increases. Since older people are more prone to sickness, the number of deaths occurring at older age groups is well represented by the given matrix “A”. These factors influence the death rate, which causes a decrease in “s”. Other factors can also influence the birth rate, such as natality rate. As more and more females are added to the population, it will naturally increase the birth rate. Another smaller factor could also be immigration, which can influence the population both positively and negatively. The Leslie Matrix can also be used in random cases, which could create uncertainties (disorder) and can create several models of populations in which some perturbation has occurred. 
Part 3: Power Method Question Two
      The eigenvalue for the Leslie Matrix at some year n, specifically, represents the magnitude of the growth rate where an eigenvalue equal to one means a stable population, less than one meaning a declining population, and greater than one meaning a growing population. In the case where the population grew normally, the eigenvalue was greater than one, meaning the population was growing. From a broader perspective, if one focuses on the convergence of the norm ||AK|| and its convergence, it is quite clear that an eigenvalue greater than one will lead to an unstable population (converge to infinity). In a further investigation of the norm, one can start with the simple definition of the norm as a square root of the maximum eigenvalue. If the value is greater than one, as stated earlier, then the square root of the eigenvalue will always be greater than 1. Thus, the norm is directly related with the eigenvalue in terms of measuring a population’s growth rate. An eigenvalue greater than one portrays population growth which can in the long run be classified as unstable.  As a result, in both cases, the population will eventually become unstable.
